#Overriding
---

In this section, we're going to continue with the Square class by overriding the method super class' method, Point_Draw( ). Overriding has two implications.

* The method implemented by the super class is changed to a new implementation by the sub sub class
* The super class' implementation can still be called, but only within the overriding sub class. 

Both these concepts will be demonstrated by overriding the original Point_Draw( ), and calling the original Point_Draw( ) in the new implementation.
