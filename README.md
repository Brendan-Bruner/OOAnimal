OOAnimal
========

This repo provides a framework for object oriented programming in C. It enables classes to do single inheritance, function overriding, and polymorphism. In the application folder is an eclipse project which demonstrates how to use the framework. 

##Template Directory
This provides a temple .c and .h folder for classes. Replace the string &{file_base} in each file with the name of the file (there are many of them to replace). The name of the file should be the same name as the class. Also replace the ${include_guard_symbol} with the appropriate guard symbol for the header file. Typically this will be _FILENAME_H_.
